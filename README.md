## Description 📖

I would like to invite you to take a look at my "To do list" application. This project is a part of Frontend Developer Course that I am currently participating in.

"To do list" is a web application which allows you to create a list of tasks that needs to be done in the near future. 

There are two types of buttons next to each task:
- green button allows you to mark the task as completed or not ✅
- red button with trash icon is used to remove specific task from the board 🗑️.
