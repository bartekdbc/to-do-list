## 📖Description

I would like to invite you to take a look at my "To do list" application.

"To do list" is a web application which allows you to create a list of tasks that need to be done in the near future.

There are two types of buttons next to each task:

- green button allows you to mark the task as completed or not ✅
- red button with trash icon is used to remove specific task from the board 🗑️.

Moreover, when you type tasks in the list, two additional functionalities appear - you can either hide completed tasks or complete all the tasks listed below.

This project is a part of Frontend Developer Course that I am currently participating in.
